# DUOS CLI

This application is designed for easing the process of handling CSV data from the DUOS algorithm. Basic functionality for uploading collections of articles or rererences is included.

### Usage

```bash
# show help
$ ./duos.py
Usage: duos.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  utilitiy for loading the data for the DUOS research study.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  create   create duos database schema in target db.
  destroy  drop every table in duos database.
  info     list basic info about duos db
  upload   insert local csv into the database.
```

`create`,  `destroy`, and `info` are basic convenience tools. The real money is with `upload`.

The `upload` function expects to find CSV files in the local directory whose names match those defined in `CONSTANTS.py` ("article" or "reference" by default). Any eligible files will be normalized and inserted in the target base with little or no discrimination. Only malformed records or files with incorrect metadata will be rejected.

```bash
$ ./duos.py upload
üîç  CSVs discovered: {'articles'}...
üí¨  Working...
    ....
    .....
    ......
‚ÑπÔ∏è  3 records processed.
üôå  done!
```
